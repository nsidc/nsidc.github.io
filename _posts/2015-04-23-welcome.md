Welcome to the NSIDC Technology Blog. Soon NSIDC developers will begin filling this space with lots of great content!

<!-- more -->

The development team at [The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)](http://www.nsidc.org) build software in support of the NSIDC mission:

>Advancing Knowlede of Earth's Frozen Regions

### Technology at NSIDC

Development at NSIDC is a broad mix of technology stacks and applications. Currently we write new code in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby but our codebase includes IDL, MATLAB, C, C++, Java, and much more. We deploy our code using tools like Jenkins, Vagrant, Puppet, and VSphere to an internal cloud. All of this and more will be covered in future posts!

### What do we build?

We work on a wide range of projects from small data analysis, large data processing pipelines, to modern interactive JavaScript web applications.
