The development team at [The National Snow and Ice Data Center
(NSIDC)](http://www.nsidc.org) builds software in support of the NSIDC mission:

>Advancing Knowlede of Earth's Frozen Regions

NSIDC is the authoritative data management and science center for cryospheric data and research. We advance understanding of Earthâ€™s frozen regions and the changes taking place to inform decision-making, in service to humanity and Earth.

### Technology at NSIDC

Development at NSIDC is a broad mix of technology stacks and applications. Currently we
write new code in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby but our codebase includes IDL, MATLAB, C,
C++, Java, and much more. We deploy our code using tools like Jenkins, Vagrant, Puppet,
Docker, and vSphere to a on-premises private cloud. All of this and more will be covered
in future posts!


### What do we build?

We work on a wide range of projects from small data analysis, large data processing
pipelines, to modern interactive JavaScript web applications.
